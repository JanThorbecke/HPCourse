Open the Makefile and change the LIBS= variable to a library where BLAS can be found. For some machines the LIBS variable has already put into the makefile and uncomment (remove the # in front of the line) the correct LIBS= definition.

In case you cannot find a suitable BLAS library remove the call to sgemm in the code at line 176:

175 
176     sgemm_(transa, transb, &row, &col, &col, &alpha,
177         &matrix_a[0][0], &col, &matrix_b[0][0], &col, &beta, &matrix_r[0][0]    , &col);
178 

replace those lines with

175 /*
176     sgemm_(transa, transb, &row, &col, &col, &alpha,
177         &matrix_a[0][0], &col, &matrix_b[0][0], &col, &beta, &matrix_r[0][0]    , &col);
178  */

and in the Makefile comment out (add a # at the first position of the line) all LIBS= definitions, and compile again.

If the make command gives errors because it does not understand the -mssse3 flag remove this flag from the CFLAGS= definition and try again.  Or use the GNU compilers.

Compile the program by typing

> make

and run in by typing

./ClassicMatrixMultiply

Look at the results and try to understand the differences in loop unrolling

The results of this program will be discussed during the course.
