EXERCISE 1:   Matrix Multiply Using Autoparallelism

1.  The single-CPU execution time is about 15 seconds.


2.  This directory contains the files matmul.l and matmul.m.
    Note that the compiler has interchanged the loops with index
    30 and 32. 


3.  Runtimes are about:

    2 CPUs:   ca. 8   secs.
    3 CPUs:   ca. 5   secs.
    4 CPUs:   ca. 4   secs.

    The relevant environment variable to set the number of threads is
    OMP_NUM_THREADS.  Usage:  setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 2


4.  We have seen in question 2 that the compiler interchanges the 
    loops with label 30 and 31. We need the following OpenMP directives
    just in front of the loop with label 30:

    c$omp    parallel do
    c$omp&   shared(l,m,n,A,B,C)
    c$omp&   private(i,j,k)

    Just after the "30 continue" line, we can insert:

    c$omp end parallel do
  
    The output in files matmul.l and matmul.m shows that this time, the
    compiler has not interchanged the loops with label 30 and 31.

    Runtimes are about (note to set the OMP_NUM_THREADS value to the
    desired value, see above):

    1 CPU:    ca. 15 seconds
    2 CPUs:   ca. 17 seconds
    3 CPUS:   ca.  9 seconds
    4 CPUS:   ca.  7 seconds 

    The parallellization now is across index i, the first index of array C.
    This means that each processor is responsible for a certain amount
    of rows of array C. This is not advantageous for memory access.
    Interesting to see is that for 2 CPUs, the wallclock time goes up,
    and that it decreases again for more CPUs.

    What happens is that false sharing occurs between the processors:
    two processors write into the same cache line (note, not the
    same words in the cache line !). This is the cause of the bad
    performance.


5.  The loop with label 31 becomes now:

         do 31 j = 1,n

            x = 0.0

            do 32 k = 1,m
               x = x +A(i,k)* B(k,j)
 32         continue

            C(i,j) = x

 31      continue


    Note that variable x should be private to each thread, so 
    it must be included in the "c$omp&   private" clause.

    Compile with -O3 -mp, and run (note the OMP_NUM_THREADS 
    environment variable):

    1 CPU:    ca. 15 secs.
    2 CPUs:   ca   8 secs.
    3 CPUs:   ca   5 secs.
    4 CPUs:   ca.  4 secs.
