EXERCISE 5:   Turbulence Code
*****************************


Silicon Graphics BV

This exercise contains a somewhat larger application program.
It implements the most important computational part of a 
turbulence model (thanks to Roel Verstappen, RUG).


1.  Go to directory "src", which includes the sources and the Makefile.
    The Makefile includes the flag for automatic parallellization 
    (-pfa keep). Make executable "poisson_O3" by just typing make.

    Run the executable on 1 processor, and note the wallclock time.
    The code already contains a timer for routine "iccgp". Also note
    that wallclock time. The executable does not require any input.

    Profile the code on 1 processor with ssrun, and pay attention to
    routine "iccgp".  Make sure that you get the profile of "iccgp"
    in detail (i.e. on loop level).


2.  Run the executable on 2, 3 and 4 processors, and determine the
    wallclock times. Also, note the times for "iccgp".

    What do you observe ?


3.  Parallellize the code more efficiently, using OpenMP directives.
    Only pay attention to routine iccgp. Always check the correctness of
    the answers (which are printed to STDOUT already).
