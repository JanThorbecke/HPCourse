Apart from parallellizing do loops, there is another method of
parallellizing chunks of code. This concept is known as parallel
sections.


1.  Take a look at the source code in file ex3.f. Determine 
    whether it is possible to use the concept of parallel 
    sections here.

    Use OpenMP directives to define parallel sections. Compile
    (-O3 -mp) and execute on 1, 2, 3 and 4 processors.

    What do you observe ? What is the explanation ?


2.  Instead of using parallel sections, now parallellize the code
    using the automatic parallellization flag of the compiler. Also,
    use optimization flag -O3.

    Check the .l and .m files, and understand what transformations
    the compiler has made.

    Execute the code on 1, 2, 3 and 4 processors, and determine
    the wallclock times.

    Try to find an explanation for the observed wallclock times
    and speed-ups.


3.  Use OpenMP directives to parallellize both the 20-loop and the
    30-loop. Find a way to let the code run more efficiently, i.e.
    try to improve the parallel efficiency.

    (Hint: consider various scheduling policies within OpenMP.)
