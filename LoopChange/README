Open the Makefile and change the compiler to the one you are using and choose a low optimisation flag :
for example you can first try the lowest optimization level -O0 and then try -O1. 

> make

and run the build executable by typing

./loop

You will see different output results printed to the screen/terminal. Each output represent a certain order how the 3D array is accessed in memory. Read the code and try to explain the results. 

Now try to compile with high optimisation -O3 (or -fast depending on your compiler) and do the test again. Can you still understand the results?
