---- float accuracy
Compile the program with

gcc -O0 float.c

and run 

./a.out

in the code the floating point numbers are printed with

    fprintf(stderr,"i=%d a=%16.14f c=%10.9g d=%16.14g \n",i, a, c, d);

16.14 means that it will be printed in a area of 16 characters with 14 decimals. 


Compile the second program

gcc comparefloats.c

and run

./a.out

can you explain the outcome of these tests? What happens if you change the 'float a,b;' to 'double a,b;'


---- Rounding

You want to define receivers on a Cartesian grid (with dx=3.2) that have 12.8 between receivers; each 4 grid points a receiver

The code round.c is designed to do that.

To compile the code

gcc -c getpars.c ; gcc -Ofast -ffast-math round.c getpars.o

then run the code with the command, that defines dx,dxrcv and the origin of the grid.

./a.out dx=3.2 dxrcv=12.8 x0=-1000

The code has a check if all receivers are 4 points apart...

Do you know a way how to avoid the problem?
