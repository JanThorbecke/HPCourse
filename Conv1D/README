This program computes a 1D convolution with periodic and non-periodic boundaries.

compile the program by invoking a fortran 90 compiler with -O3 optimization. For example the GNU compiler

gfortran -O3 convolution.F90

This produces an executable with the default name a.out.

Run the executable by typing
./a.out

see the runtime. Try to change the code which gives the same answers, but is much faster. The main kernel blocks are repeated in the
source file and in each second block you can make your changes to get faster code and the same answers (upto the 6'th digit).

Hints:
- Try to get rid of the modulo operator in the most inner loop.
- The min and max in the innerloop are not good for a compiler to generate fast code.
- Think about introducing temporary arrays...
