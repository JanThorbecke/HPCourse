Open the Makefile and change the LIBS= variable to a library where BLAS can be found. For some machines the LIBS variable has
already put into the makefile and uncomment (remove the # in front of the line) the correct LIBS= definition.

In case you cannot find a suitable BLAS library remove the call to sgemm in the code at line 176:

175 
176     sgemm_(transa, transb, &row, &col, &col, &alpha,
177         &matrix_a[0][0], &col, &matrix_b[0][0], &col, &beta, &matrix_r[0][0]    , &col);
178 

replace those lines with

175 /*
176     sgemm_(transa, transb, &row, &col, &col, &alpha,
177         &matrix_a[0][0], &col, &matrix_b[0][0], &col, &beta, &matrix_r[0][0]    , &col);
178  */

and in the Makefile comment out (add a # at the first position of the line) all LIBS= definitions, and compile again.

If the make command gives errors because it does not understand the -mssse3 flag remove this flag from the CFLAGS= definition and
try again.  Or use the GNU compilers.

Compile the program by typing

> make

Before you run the program check the source code and see what the program is doing. Try to predict what would be the best blocking
size. Now run the program  

./ClassicMatrixMultiply


As an extra exercise use the unroll routine which can be found in the same source code.

The results of this program will be discussed during the course.
